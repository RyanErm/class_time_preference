# BSDS Class Time Preferences

## Description
This data was collected through an anonymous survey sent out to all undergraduate data science students. The survey was sent out by the Undergraduate Data Science Council. We present this information to better inform the class time preference selection for future cohorts. 

Overall, data was collected from 28 undergraduate students. 13 of these students were second-years and 15 of these students were third-years. 

## Questions
### The survey asked three main question:
1. Do you prefer "blocks" of classes (e.g. two classes from 9:30 AM-12:15 PM) or stand alone classes (e.g. one class from 3:30-4:45 PM)
2. Please rank which block class times you prefer
3. Please rank which stand alone class times you prefer?
The results to the questions are presented below
