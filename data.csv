Class of 2028,Blocks of Classes,"I think it makes scheduling easier if the classes are set up back to back. Especially since SDS's location is out of the way from most of my other classes. Only having to walk there once a day is way better than having to walk there once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Also, I would rather two 1hr15min lectures than three 50min blocks, one of which would be on friday. ",1,3,2,4,6,3,1,2,4,5
